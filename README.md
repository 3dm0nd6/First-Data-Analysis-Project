# First-Data-Analysis-Project
This is going to be my first project where I import, clean, visualize, and make sense of a database on FIFA 19 players I imported from 'Javagar M' on Kaggle. The dataset provides information such ad name,ID,overall,potential,club, and more.

I will continue to make visualizations through graphs and python programs for this database. 

Thank you for witnessing the first of my many projects
